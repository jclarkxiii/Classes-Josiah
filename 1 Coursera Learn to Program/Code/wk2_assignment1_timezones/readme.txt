Fun stuff: a Graphical User Interface!
This will not work correctly until you have finished the rest of the assignment!

We provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that shows four clocks and allows you to choose time zones to display. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your a1.py file:

a1_gui.py
Open a1_gui.py in IDLE, select Run -> Run Module, and see the clocks in action!

You are not expected to understand the code in a1_gui.py.

Here's a screenshot; notice that clocks can have a light or dark background depending on whether they indicate a time before or after noon. We've also provided buttons for speeding up and slowing down the clocks in case you want to see what happens around midnight and so on.
